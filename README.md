# Multi-Cloud Deployment with Disaster Recovery

This project implements a robust multi-cloud deployment architecture with automated disaster recovery capabilities across AWS and Azure/GCP, ensuring high availability and zero-downtime recovery.

## Architecture Overview

- **Primary Infrastructure**: AWS (EKS)
- **Secondary Infrastructure**: Azure (AKS)
- **Tools & Technologies**:
  - Terraform: Infrastructure as Code
  - Kubernetes: Container Orchestration
  - Velero: Backup and Recovery
  - Consul: Service Discovery and Configuration

## Features

- Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- Kubernetes cluster setup across multiple clouds
- Automated backup and recovery with Velero
- Service mesh and discovery with Consul
- Zero-downtime failover automation
- Cross-cloud networking and security configurations

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Azure CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- kubectl configured
- Helm >= 3.0.0

## Getting Started

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Initialize and deploy AWS infrastructure
   - Initialize and deploy Azure infrastructure
   - Configure cross-cloud networking

2. **Kubernetes Configuration**
   - Deploy applications across clusters
   - Set up Velero for backup/restore
   - Configure Consul for service mesh

3. **Disaster Recovery Setup**
   - Configure backup schedules
   - Set up automated failover mechanisms
   - Test recovery procedures

## Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Provisioning

- Terraform modules for each cloud provider
- Network configurations for cross-cloud communication
- Security group and IAM configurations

### Kubernetes Setup

- EKS cluster in AWS (Primary)
- AKS cluster in Azure (Secondary)
- Cross-cluster service discovery

### Backup Strategy

- Regular automated backups using Velero
- Cross-region backup storage
- Automated backup verification

### Failover Automation

- Health monitoring and alerting
- Automated failover triggers
- Zero-downtime application migration

## Security Considerations

- Encrypted cross-cloud communication
- IAM and RBAC configurations
- Network security policies
- Secrets management

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging
- Cross-cloud metrics collection
- Alerting and notification setup
